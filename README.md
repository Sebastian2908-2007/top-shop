Note: Its on eco-dynos for now so initial load will be slow.

 ## Description
 This is an e-commerce platform that mainly deals in workout equipment. I will note that this is started from the repo sybs crafty shack created for a client that had some misfortune befall them. So instead of letting the project die, I created an e-commerce app that I could use for myself If I so chose to do so. Since this is a next app with a different server in the application the server is hosted separately on heroku and can be found in my repositories as top-shop-server. Another special note to add is the fact that you could really sell anything since all products and categories are easily edited via an admin login. 
In theory, this code could be forked and styled to meet any e-commerce brand's needs.
